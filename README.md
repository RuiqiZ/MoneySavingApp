# Team Rocket

Team Rocket's budget management system (BMS) is an application which provides users with a means of tracking and budgeting their expenses on a month to month basis. BMS is focused around helping users save money through dividing their currency into “jars”, which represent financial goals for how much money a user wants to spend on different purposes (such as “school”, “food”, etc.).
