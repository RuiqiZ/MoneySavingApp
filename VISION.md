# Our Vision

The budget management system (BMS) is an application which provides users with a means of tracking and budgeting their expenses on a month to month basis. BMS is focused around helping users save money through dividing their currency into “jars”, which represent financial goals for how much money a user wants to spend on different purposes (such as “school”, “food”, etc.). 

## Functionality 
BMS is a completely personalized system. It allows the user to create as many jars as they please with titles they specify. Each jar will have its own budget. The jar’s budget is the amount of money a user can spend on a given purpose. When a purchase is made, the user will log the expense under a jar, subtracting the price from the jar’s current balance. At the end of every month, the BMS will collect each jar’s remaining money and total it with previous months savings. At the beginning of each month, BMS will refill each jar to its original budgeted amount. If the user had difficulty keeping a jar’s budget, they will have the opportunity to increase their budget if necessary or keep it the same so they can improve their spending the following month.

Expense tracking is a large part of BMS, as it will allow users to visualize their spending habits and plan for future month’s. Each jar will include a running history of expenses made per month. Logged expenses will support a tagging system so that users can categorize expenses within a jar. With these tags, users will be able to filter their expense history by a given tag. Additionally, users will be able to attach notes to expenses for remembering important information regarding a purchase.

BMS will provide users with monthly performance on how they are meeting their financial goals. At the end of each month users will be shown a percentage representing the amount a user has saved. It will also show them how much they saved in previous months by providing a graph and/or list.

## Audience

The target audience for BMS is anyone with poor money management skills. Since the user is directly involved, they will know which jars caused the most issues in their spending by reviewing their end balance for each jar. Majority of people do not use cash as their main currency because a lot of money today is done electronically. This system will help users visualize dividing and budgeting their total currency, whether it is electronic or cash. The application will not directly manage the users real money.

The system is envisioned to be on a mobile application so the user will always have the application with them. This way the user will always be up to date via notifications informing them when they are halfway through the month and when it is the end of the month.

## Measurement of success

BMS will be considered successful if users on average save 5-10% per month and more than half of all users are active on a weekly basis, three months after initially installing the application.
